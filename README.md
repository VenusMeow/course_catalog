This is the finished version of PA Rails, all three parts!

In this rudimentary ruby on rails app, information about subjects, courses and instructors are loaded from JSON databases and displayed on separate pages. Bootstrap CSS stylesheet are used for UI.

Part 2 updates: The user can now search for a specific course and enroll it, the user can also view all the enrolled courses.

Part 3 updates: The search is now "active" with JavaScript and Ajax.
Note: There is a small drawback to the design of the system, if you search for some particular course
and then decide to clear both of your search fields, the results will load with all the courses
automatically.
